We’re thrilled to announce that today, June 4th, we’re officially launching our Indiegogo campaign for our upcoming short documentary, *In My Mind’s Eye – Unlocking Synaesthesia*.

By supporting our Indiegogo campaign, you’re not just helping us finish the film — you’re also helping to amplify awareness and understanding of a neurological trait that is still widely misunderstood.

The campaign will be live for the next 40 days.
Spread the word and stay tuned!
