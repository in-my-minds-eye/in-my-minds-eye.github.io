After 7 months of filming, we wrapped production on our documentary at the end of October. What an incredible journey it’s been!
The team has taken a well-deserved break, and now it’s time to dive into post-production.

We have a ton of fascinating footage to go through as the first step—selecting the best moments to assemble into the final film.
We want to send out the BIGGEST thank you to everyone who has supported the documentary so far.
Every follow, like, view, and donation has meant the world to us. We’re incredibly excited to move into post-production and can’t wait to see how the film comes together. Stay tuned!

And by the way, you can still help! Keep watching our teaser on Zoe's YouTube channel [@zoesthesia](https://www.youtube.com/@zoesthesia).
Every cent the video earns will go directly toward helping us finish post-production.
