A day to acknowledge, celebrate, and better understand one of the most under-researched neurological conditions. July 2nd is a day to celebrate and bring Synaesthesia to the worldâ€™s attention!

Some of the most prolific and notable entertainers, artists, authors and even Nobel laureate physicists throughout history have been synaesthetes. Synaesthesia is even a valuable gateway for us to better understand memory, perception and even human consciousness. Yet, this remarkable condition remains under-researched, misunderstood and virtually unknown to most of the population.
