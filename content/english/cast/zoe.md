Zoe is a self-diagnosed synaesthetic artist based in Ofuna, Japan.
She discovered her synaesthesia at the age of 25, when she found out that others couldn’t see the colour of their own voices.

This realisation set Zoe on a journey of self-discovery, inspiring the Instagram and YouTube channels @zoesthesia, where she shares her experiences with synaesthesia and its impact on her daily life.

In 2023, Zoe connected with fellow synaesthete Maike and currently co-produces the podcast *Let’s Talk Synaesthesia*. As her online following grew, so did her challenges, including backlash and misconceptions.
