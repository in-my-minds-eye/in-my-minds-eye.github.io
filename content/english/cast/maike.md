Maike (30, Germany) is a self-diagnosed autistic and synaesthete.
She discovered her unique perception of the world at 8 and has identified 10 distinct forms of synaesthesia coexisting in her brain.

Trained as a psychologist, Maike specialised in coaching and supporting neurodivergent adults.
From 2023, her podcast *Let’s Talk Synaesthesia* invites synaesthetes and scientists to discuss neurodiversity and synaesthesia.

In 2024, Maike joined the board of the UK Synaesthesia Association (UKSA) and moved to Oxford in 2025, where she hopes to continue advocating for the cause.
