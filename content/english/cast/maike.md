Maike (30, Germany) is a self-diagnosed autistic and synesthete.
She discovered her unique perception of the world at 8 and has identified 10 distinct forms of synesthesia coexisting in her brain.

Trained as a psychologist, Maike specialized in coaching  and supporting neurodivergent adults.
From 2023, her podcast *Let’s Talk Synaesthesia* invites synesthetes and scientists to discuss neurodiversity and synesthesia.

In 2024, Maike joined the board of the UK Synaesthesia Association (UKSA) and in 2025 moved to Oxford, where she hopes to continue advocating for the cause.
