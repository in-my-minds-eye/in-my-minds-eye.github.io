    content: "We are Maike and Zoe - 2 women with synaesthesia, from 2 corners of the world, on 1 journey. Weâ€™re very excited to be part of this short intimate documentary, that plunges into our vulnerabilities of having a fascinating, rarely spoken about neurodivergent trait. Support us in spreading awareness about synaesthesia, fostering community, and building a more understanding and empathetic world. We invite you, in any way you can, big or small, to be a part of our journey."

    content: "*People think that the reality exists out there in the world. And it really doesn't. Reality exists in our own brains. It's a construct that we make for all kinds of information, and it is certainly an individual construct.*
