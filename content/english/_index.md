    content: "We are Maike and Zoe - two women with synaesthesia, from two corners of the world, on one journey. Weâ€™re very excited to be part of this short, intimate documentary that plunges into our vulnerabilities of having a fascinating, rarely spoken about neurodivergent trait. We invite you to be part of our journey in spreading awareness about synaesthesia, fostering community, and building a more understanding and empathetic world."

    content: "*People think that the reality exists out there in the world. And it really doesn't. Reality exists in our own brains. It's a construct that we make for all kinds of information, and it is certainly an individual construct.*
