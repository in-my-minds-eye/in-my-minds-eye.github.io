Synaesthesia means senses intertwine: numbers may have colours, words may have peculiar tastes, and music can be felt as shapes and textures. These synaesthetic experiences are consistent and involuntarily triggered by a specific sense, which means synaesthetes are often, if not always, unable to control them. On top of that, the same trigger can stimulate very different synaesthetic manifestations in different synaesthetes, making the whole experience incredibly subjective. 

So, what is it like to live in such a different world, where perception is continuous and personal? Is it a gift or a challenge?

*In My Mind’s Eye – Unlocking Synaesthesia* explores the daily reality of living with synaesthesia, beyond its wonderous nature, through the eyes of two remarkable synaesthetes:
- Maike, a German psychologist and neurodiversity coach, now relocated to the UK and hopeful to expand her advocacy efforts in a new community;
- Zoe, a Singaporean synaesthesia artist and advocate, living in Japan, who shares her experiences with the world through her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zoesthesia/) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@zoesthesia/featured) @zoesthesia. 

United by their experiences and the podcast they co-host, [*Let’s Talk Synaesthesia*](https://open.spotify.com/show/5nNVhDKe24Z12GjtFl0jVf), they guide us on a multisensory journey through emotions, neurodiverse identity, creativity, and advocacy. 

Through candid conversations, the documentary will delve into how synaesthesia affects their social interactions, identity, and daily experiences. You will also be offered a unique opportunity to see the world through their eyes, as calibrated animations overlay real-time footage to simulate their synaesthetic perceptions. These visuals provide an immersive experience, allowing viewers to temporarily step into Zoe’s and Maike’s vibrant and complex realities.

Ultimately, with this short documentary, we aim to explore the pros and cons of living with synaesthesia, the challenges and opportunities that arise when speaking publicly about it, and the role of community in building awareness, while painting an authentic and empathic portrait of Maike and Zoe. Through their journey, we hope to spark more profound reflection on the complexity and uniqueness of human perception, whether synaesthetic or not, inviting everyone to embrace the richness of how we experience the world.
